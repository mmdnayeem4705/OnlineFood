# OnlineFood
The Online Food Ordering System is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of ordering food online. This project is hosted locally on a XAMPP server and is accessible via http://localhost/OnlineFood/. It leverages PHP as the backend scripting language and MySQL as the database management system to provide a dynamic and interactive platform for users and administrators. The primary purpose of this project is to allow customers to browse food items, place orders, and manage transactions, while administrators can oversee menu management, order tracking, and customer data.

The project establishes a connection to a MySQL database named onlinefood using a PHP script (connect.php). This script ensures seamless interaction between the application and the database by utilizing the mysqli_connect function. The database likely contains tables for storing essential information such as user accounts, food items, orders, and payment details. The connection script also includes basic error handling to notify developers if the database connection fails, ensuring that issues can be identified and resolved promptly.

The application is built to provide a user-friendly experience. Customers can explore a variety of food items, add them to their cart, and place orders effortlessly. On the administrative side, the system allows for efficient management of menus, order statuses, and customer interactions. The use of PHP ensures that the application can dynamically generate web pages and process user requests in real time.

This project is hosted in a local development environment using XAMPP, which provides the necessary components, including Apache for the web server and MySQL for the database server. The system is designed to be scalable, with potential for enhancements such as user authentication, integration of payment gateways, and the addition of a responsive front-end framework like Bootstrap for improved design and usability.

In summary, the Online Food Ordering System is a foundational project that simplifies food ordering and management processes. It is a robust and flexible platform with room for further development, making it an ideal solution for small to medium-sized food businesses looking to establish an online presence.
