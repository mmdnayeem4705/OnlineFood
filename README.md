# OnlineFood
The Online Food Ordering System is a web-based app hosted on XAMPP, using PHP and MySQL. It connects to the onlinefood database to manage users, food items, orders, and transactions. Customers can browse and order food, while admins manage menus and orders. Itâ€™s scalable, with potential for features like payment gateways and responsive design.
